/*
âœ… Time Complexity: O(n)
The method loops through half the array (from both ends toward the center), but Big O ignores constants.

So, even though it swaps n/2 pairs, it's considered O(n).

ğŸ“Œ Reason: Every element is visited once (in a pair), resulting in linear time with respect to the size of the input array.

âœ… Space Complexity: O(1)
The reversal is done in-place, without allocating extra space for another array (only a few temp variables).

ğŸ“Œ Reason: The amount of additional memory used does not grow with input size â€” it's constant.

Summary:
Complexity Type	Value
Time	O(n)
Space	O(1)
